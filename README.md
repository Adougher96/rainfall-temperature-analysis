# Rainfall and Temperature Analysis

## Overview
This project compares climate data from the United States and Great Britain. Using R and the command line interface, the project analyzes rainfall and temperature statistics to test whether higher temperatures are associated with more rainfall.

## Tools Used
- R
- RStudio
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- CSV files

## Key Concepts
- Data wrangling and summary statistics in R
- Matrix and vector operations
- Hypothesis testing with real-world data
- CLI for file navigation and manipulation

## Findings
- Despite similar average temperatures, Great Britain has significantly higher rainfall than the U.S.
- The hypothesis that more rainfall follows higher temperature does not hold across both countries

## Files in this Repo
- `DAT-500 Final Project.docx`: Full project write-up and reflection
- `climate_comparison.R`: R script to calculate and compare summary stats
